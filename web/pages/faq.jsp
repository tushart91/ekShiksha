India --> One Country --> One Education
Our honourable minister for HRD has mooted the idea of a single unified examination at the end of the schooling system across all states. Education ministers are already debating the idea.
We see no reason why common science subjects have to be taught differently across the breadth of India. After all the laws of physics, Chemistry and mathematics are the same across all humanity.
We have therefore built and deployed technology which will enable single web content (html) file to be translated into all the supported Indian languages.
For demonstrating the concept, we have used the freely downloadable CBSE science textbook as our single education source. This has been presented as translatable content. Individuals across India who have reasonably proficient in the subject and their mother tongue can register as ‘translators’. Once vetted, they can ‘translate’ the content either partially or fully. The ‘translated’ content will then be available to all.
Given the implications of the Right to Education act and the continued scarcity of quality teachers, we believe that making quality content available through internet (or through local disks) will enhance the quality of education in government schools. We also recognize that there is a visible trend towards using computers in government schools. Given this scenario, we believe that our methodology is adopted on a large scale will benefit the children studying in government schools.
We also believe that the learning experience can be vastly enhanced by using simulations and multimedia aids backed up by online quizzes. Our next step will be to ‘convert’ the CBSE text into an interactive learning experience through simulations and online tests/quizzes.
