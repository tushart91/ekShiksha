      <h1>Light</h1>
      <p>You might have seen a beam of sunlight when it enters a room through a narrow opening or a hole.You may have also seen beams of light from the headlamps of scooters, cars and engines of trains [Fig.1(a)]. Similarly, a beam of light can be seen from a torch. Some of</p>

  <h2>1. LIGHT TRAVELS ALONG A STRAIGHT LINE</h2>
      <p>Boojho recalls an activity he performed in Class VI. In that activity he looked at a lighted candle first through a straight pipe and then through a bent pipe (Fig. 2). Why was Boojho not able to see the candle flame through a bent pipe? </p><p>This activity showed that light travels along straight lines.</p><p>How can we change the path of light? Do you know, what happens when light falls on a polished or a shiny surface?</p>

  <h2>2.REFLECTION OF LIGHT</h2>
      <p>One way to change the direction of light is to let it fall on a shiny surface. For example, a shining stainless steel plate or a shining steel spoon can change the direction of light. The surface of water can also act like a mirror and change the path of light. Have you ever seen the reflection of trees or buildings in water (Fig.3)?</p><p>Any polished or a shiny surface can act as a mirror. What happens when light falls on a mirror?</p><p>You have learnt in Class VI that a mirror changes the direction of light that falls on it. This change of direction by a mirror is called reflection of light. Can you recall the activity in which you got the light of a torch reflected from a mirror? Let us perform a similar activity.</p>
<fieldset class="activity">
    <legend class="activity-legend">Activity 1</legend>
     <p>Take a torch. Cover its glass with a chart paper which has three slits as shown in Fig.5. Spread a sheet of chart paper</p>
  <fieldset class="what-learnt">
     <p>Paheli remembers the story of the lion and the rabbit from the Panchtantra, in which the rabbit fooled the lion by showing him his reflection in water (Fig.4).
     </p>
       <div class="images"><img src="images_light_VII/figure_4.JPG"><br>Fig.4 Reflection of the lion in water</div>
  </fieldset>
       <div class="images"><img src="images_light_VII/figure_5.JPG"><br>Fig.5 Reflection of light from a mirror</div>
    <p>on a smooth wooden board. Fix a plane mirror strip vertically on the chart paper (Fig.5). Now direct the beam of light on the mirror from the torch with slits. Place the torch in such a way that its light is seen along the chart paper on the board. Now adjust its position so that the light from the torch strikes the plane mirror at an angle (Fig.5).</p><p>Does the mirror change the direction of light that falls on it? Now move the torch slightly to either side. Do you find any change in the direction of reflected light?</p><p>Look into the mirror along the direction of the reflected light. Do you see the slits in the mirror? This is the image of the slits.
<fieldset class="know-more">
Paheli wants to know, what makes things visible to us? Boojho thinks that objects are visible only when light reflected from them reaches our eyes. Do you agree with him? </fieldset>
This activity shows how light gets reflected from a plane mirror.</p><p>Let us play around with the images formed in mirrors and know a little more about them.</p>
</fieldset>
<fieldset class="activity">
    <legend class="activity-legend">Activity 2</legend>
<div class="think">
<div class="think-heading"> CAUTION</div>
<p>Never touch a lighted electric bulb connected to the mains. It may be very hot and your hand may get burnt badly. Do not experiment with the electric supply from the mains or a generator or an inverter. You may get an electric shock, which may be dangerous. Use only electric cells for all the activities suggested here.</p>
</div>
     <p>Place a lighted candle in front of a plane mirror. Try to see the flame of the candle in the mirror. It appears as if a similar candle is placed behind the mirror. The candle, which appears behind the mirror, is the image of the candle formed by the mirror (Fig.6). The candle itself is the object.</p><p>Now move the candle to different positions in front of the mirror. Observe the image in each case.</p>
       <div class="images"><img src="images_light_VII/figure_6.JPG"><br>Fig.6 Image of a candle in a plane mirror</div>
       <fieldset class="know-more">
Boojho noted in his notebook: Is it not surprising that my image is of the same size as me whether the mirror is small or large? 
</fieldset>
     <p>Was the image upright in each case? Did the flame appear on top of the candle as in the object? Such an image is called erect. An image formed by a plane mirror is erect and of the same size as the object.</p><p>Now place a vertical screen behind the mirror. Try to obtain the image of the candle on this screen. Can you get the image on the screen? Now place the screen in front of the mirror. Can you get the image on the screen now? You will find that the image of the candle  cannot be obtained on the screen in either case.</p><p>What about the distance of the image from mirror? Let us perform another activity.</p>
</fieldset>
<fieldset class="activity">
    <legend class="activity-legend">Activity 3</legend>
   <p>Take a chess board. If a chess board is not available, draw on a chart paper 64 (88) squares of equal size. Draw a thick line in the middle of the paper. Fix a plane mirror vertically on this line. Place any small object, such as a pencil sharpner, at the boundary of the third square counting from the mirror (Fig.7). Note the position of the image. Now shift the object to the boundary of the fourth square. Again note the position of the image. Did you find any relation between the distance of the image from the mirror and that of the object in front of it?</p>  
       <div class="images"><img src="images_light_VII/figure_7.JPG"><br>Fig.7 Locating image in a plane mirror</div>
       <fieldset class="know-more">
Paheli made a note in her notebook: In a plane mirror the image is formed behind the mirror. It is erect, of the same size and is at the same distance from the mirror as the object is in front of it.
</fieldset>
   <p>You will find that the image is at the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front of it. Now verify this by placing the object anywhere on the chart paper. </p>
</fieldset>

<h2>3.RIGHT OR LEFT!</h2>
  <p>When you see your image in a plane mirror, is it exactly like you? Have you ever noticed that there is one interesting difference between you and your image in a mirror? Let us find out.</p>

<fieldset class="activity">
    <legend class="activity-legend">Activity 4</legend>
   <p>Stand in front of a plane mirror and look at your image. Raise your left hand. Which hand does your image raise (Fig. 8)? Now touch your right ear. Which ear does your hand touch in your image? Observe carefully. You will find that in the mirror the ‘right’ appears ‘left’ and the ‘left’ appears ‘right’. Note that only sides are interchanged; the image does not appear upside down.</p><p>Now write down your name on a piece of paper and hold it in front of a plane mirror. How does it appear in the mirror?</p>  
      <div class="images"><img src="images_light_VII/figure_8.JPG"><br>Fig.8 Left hand appears on the right side in the image</div>
      <div class="images"><img src="images_light_VII/figure_9.JPG"><br>Fig.9 An Ambulance</div>
      <div class="images">Image will be here</div>
	  <fieldset class="know-more">
	  Boojho saw an ambulance on the road. He was surprised to see that the word ‘AMBULANCE’ in front was written in a strange manner.
	  </fieldset>
   <p>Can you now understand why the word ‘AMBULANCE’ is written as in Fig. 9 ? When the driver of a vehicle ahead of an ambulance looks in her/his rear view mirror, he/she can read ‘AMBULANCE’ written on it and give way to it. It is the duty of every one of us to allow an ambulance to pass without blocking its way.</p><p>
      You might have observed that in the side mirror of a scooter or a car the images of all the objects appear smaller than the objects themselves. Have you ever wondered why it is so?</p>
</fieldset>

<h2>4.PLAYING WITH SPHERICAL MIRRORS</h2>
<p>Paheli and Boojho were waiting for their dinner. Boojho lifted a stainless steel plate and saw his image in it. Oh! This plate acts as a plane mirror. My image is erect and is of the same size. Paheli saw her image using the back of a steel spoon. “Boojho look here! I can also see my erect image though it is smaller in size. This spoon also acts as a mirror of some kind”, said Paheli.</p><p>You can also use a spoon or any curved shining surface to see your image.</p>

<fieldset class="activity">
    <legend class="activity-legend">Activity 5</legend>
   <p>Take a stainless steel spoon. Bring the outer side of the spoon near your face and look into it. Do you see your image in it (Fig. 10)? Is this image different from what you see in a plane mirror? Is this image erect? Is the size of the image the same, smaller or larger?</p>  
      <div class="images"><img src="images_light_VII/figure_10.JPG"><br>Fig.10 Image from the outer side of a spoon</div>
   <p>Now look at your image using the inner side of the spoon. This time you may find that your image is erect and larger in size. If you increase the distance of the spoon from your face, you may see your image inverted (Fig.11). You can also compare the image of your pen or pencil instead of your face.</p>
      <div class="images"><img src="images_light_VII/figure_11.JPG"><br>Fig.11 Image from the inner side of a spoon</div>
<p>The curved shining surface of a spoon acts as a mirror. The most common example of a curved mirror is a spherical mirror.</p><p>If the reflecting surface of a spherical mirror is concave, it is called a concave mirror. If the reflecting surface is convex, then it is a convex mirror (Fig.12). </p>
      <div class="images"><img src="images_light_VII/figure_12.JPG"><br>Fig.12 A Comcave and Convex mirror</div>
<fieldset class="what-learnt">
    <p> Why are concave and convex mirrors called spherical mirrors?</p><p>Take a rubber ball and cut a portion of it with a knife or a hacksaw blade [Fig.13(a)]. (Be careful. Ask an elder person to help you in cutting the ball). The inner surface of the cut ball is called concave and the outer surface is called convex (Fig.13(b)).</p>

</fieldset>
 <p>The inner surface of a spoon acts like a concave mirror, while its outer surface acts like a convex mirror.</p><p>We know that the image of an object formed by a plane mirror cannot be obtained on a screen. Let us investigate if it is also true for the image formed by a concave mirror. </p>
</fieldset>

<fieldset class="activity">
    <legend class="activity-legend">Activity 6</legend>
<div class="think">
<div class="think-heading"> CAUTION</div>
<p>You will conduct Activity 6 in the sunlight. Be careful, never look directly towards the sun or its image as it may damage your eyes. You may look at the image of the sun when it is thrown on a screen or a wall.</p>
</div>
         <div class="images"><img src="images_light_VII/figure_14.JPG"><br>Fig.14 A concave mirror forms a real image of the sun</div>
    
   <p>Take a concave mirror. Hold it facing the sun. Try to get the light reflected by the mirror on a sheet of paper. Adjust the distance of the paper until you get a sharp bright spot on it (Fig. 14). Hold the mirror and the sheet of paper steady for a few minutes. Does the paper start burning?</p><p>
    This bright spot is, in fact, the image of the sun. Notice that this image is formed on a screen. An image formed on a screen is called a real image.
Recollect that in Activity 2 the image formed by a plane mirror could not be obtained on a screen. Such an image is called a virtual image.</p><p>
    Now let us try to obtain on the screen the image of a candle flame formed by a concave mirror.</p>
</fieldset>

<fieldset class="activity">
    <legend class="activity-legend">Activity 7</legend>
    <p>Fix a concave mirror on a stand (any arrangement to keep the mirror steady would do) and place it on a table(Fig.15). Paste a piece of white paper on a cardboard sheet (say about </p>

Is it of the same size as the flame?</p><p>Now move the candle towards the mirror and place it at different distances from it. In each case try to obtain the image on the screen. Record your observation in Table 1. Is it possible to obtain the image on the screen when the candle is too close to the mirror (Fig.16)?</p><p>We see that the image formed by a concave mirror can be smaller or larger in size than the object. The image may also be real or virtual.</p><p>Concave mirrors are used for many purposes. You might have seen doctors using concave mirrors for examining eyes, ears, nose and throat. Concave mirrors are also used by dentists to see an enlarged image of the teeth (Fig.17). The reflectors of torches,headlights of cars and scooters are concave in shape (Fig.18).</p>

Convex mirrors can form images of objects spread over a large area. So, these help the drivers to see the traffic behind them (Fig.20).</p>

<h2>5.IMAGES FORMED BY LENSES</h2>
<p>You might have seen a magnifying glass. It is used to read very small print (Fig.21).</p><p>You might have also used it to observe the body parts of a cockroach or an earthworm. The magnifying glass is actually a type of a lens.</p><p>Lenses are widely used in spectacles, telescopes and microscopes. Try to add a few more uses of lenses to this list.</p><p>Get some lenses.

<fieldset class="what-learnt">
    <p>A convex lens converges (bends inward) the light generally falling on it [Fig.24 (a)]. Therefore, it is called a converging lens. On the other hand, a concave lens diverges (bends outward) the light and is called a diverging lens [Fig.24 (b)]. </p>

<h2>6.SUNLIGHT — WHITE OR COLOURED?</h2>
<p>Have you ever seen a rainbow in the sky? You might have noticed that it appears usually after the rain when the sun is low in the sky. The rainbow is seen as a large arc in the sky with many colours (Fig.28).</p>

<p>Take a circular cardboard disc of about 10 cm diameter. Divide this disc into seven segments. Paint the seven rainbow colours on these segments as shown in Fig.31 (a). You can also paste, coloured papers on these segments. Make a small hole at the centre of the disc. Fix the disc loosely on the tip of a refill of a ball pen. Ensure that the disc rotates freely [Fig.31 (a)]. Rotate the disc in the daylight. When the disc is rotated fast, the colours get mixed together and the disc appears to be whitish [Fig.31 (b)].

                 <li>A burning candle in water<br>Take a shoe box, open on one side. Place a small lighted candle in it. Place a clear glass sheet (roughly 25 cm 25 cm) infront of this candle (Fig.33). Try to locate the image of the candle behind  <div class="images"><img src="images_light_VII/figure_33.JPG"><br>Fig.33 Candle burning in water </div> the glass sheet. Place a glass of water at its position. Ask your friends to look at the image of the candle through the sheet of glass. Ensure that candle is not visible to your friends. Your friends will be surprised to see the candle burning in water. Try to explain the reason.</li>

Take a hosepipe  or a water pipe used in the garden. Make a fine spray in front of you. You can see different colours of rainbow in the spray.</li> 
                  <li>Visit a laughing gallery in some science centre or a science park or avillage mela. You will find some large mirrors there. You can see your distorted and funny images in these mirrors. Try to find out the kind of mirrors used there.</li>
                  <li>Visit a nearby hospital. You can also visit the clinic of an ENT specialist, or a dentist.Request the doctor to show you the mirrors used for examining ear, nose, throat and teeth. Can you recognise the kind of mirror used in these instruments?</li>
                  <li>Role play<br> Here is a game that a group of children can play. One child will be chosen to act as object and another will act as the image of the object. The object and the image will sit opposite to each other. The object will make movements, such as raising a hand, touching an ear, etc. The image will have to make the correct movement following the movement of the object. The rest of the group will watch the movements of the image. If the image fails to make the correct movement, she/he will be retired. Another child will take her/his place and the game will continue. A scoring scheme can be introduced. The group that scores the maximum will be declared the winner.</li>

        The mirrors can be used as weapons. Archimedes, a Greek scientist, is said to have done just that more than two thousand years ago. When the Romans attacked Syracuse, a coastal city-state in Greece, Archimedes used mirrors arranged as shown in Fig. 34. The mirrors could be moved in any direction. They were positioned such that they reflected the sunlight on the Roman soldiers. The soldiers were dazzled by the sunlight. They did not know what was happening. They got confused and ran away. This was an example of triumph of ideas over military might.
